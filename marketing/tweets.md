# KOTOMO Launch & Hype Tweets

**Strategy:** These tweets focus on the "Magic" moment—turning text into a conversation. They leverage the "Linear-style" design we built to signal quality.

**Important:** For *every* tweet, attach a 10-15s video of the UI glowing/generating, or a high-res screenshot of the Audio Player card.

### 2. The "Quality" Flex (Tech Stack)
We didn't just want "Text-to-Speech."
We wanted a conversation.

Powered by:
🧠 Claude 3.5 (Logic & Scripting)
🗣️ Cartesia Sonic-3 (Human-level Voice)
✨ Next.js + Framer (Linear-style UI)

It sounds so real, you'll forget it's AI.
Turn sound on. 🔊

### 3. The "Visual" Tease (Design Focused)
Software should feel like magic.
But it should also look like art.

We spent weeks refining the details:
- Glassmorphism cards
- Reactive audio visualizers
- Cinematic HLS backgrounds

KOTOMO isn't just a tool. It's an experience.
Shipping soon. 🚢

### 5. The "Impossible" Demo
"AI voices sound robotic."
Not anymore.

Listen to these two AI agents debate the future of React Server Components. The pauses, the interruptions, the tone... it's all generated on the fly.

This is KOTOMO.

### 6. The "Learning" Use Case
I used to have 20 tabs open. Now I have 1 playlist.

I built KOTOMO to solve my own problem: I want to learn deep topics while I drive, run, and cook.

- Input: "Explain Quantum Entanglement"
- Output: A funny, 5-minute deep dive podcast.

Who else needs this? 👇

### 7. The "Vibe" Tweet (Short & Punchy)
Static text is boring.
Dynamic audio is engaging.

We built the bridge.

KOTOMO v1.0 is almost ready.
Be the first to listen.

How we built a podcast studio in the browser:

- Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind for that clean "Linear" look
- Real-time streaming with HLS.js
- Edge functions for <60s latency

The stack is stacked.
Follow along as we ship v1. 🛠️

We're opening up 100 spots for the KOTOMO beta this weekend.

Let's make some noise. 🎙️

### 10. The Vision
The internet is shifting.
From "Read-Write" -> "Ask-Listen."

KOTOMO is your personal audio engine for the web.

Don't just read the internet. Listen to it.
